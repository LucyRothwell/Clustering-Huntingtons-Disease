# Clustering Huntingtons Disease
A research project aiming to subtype Huntington's Disease to improve clinical trial cohort selection: Unsupervised machine learning with clinical & genetic data. (2020)

**Objective**

The main objective of this study was to determine whether data-driven subtypes of
Huntington's Disease (HD) exist based on motor, cognitive and psychiatric clinical symptoms. A secondary objective was to test whether symptomatic variance existed independently of the biomarker, CAG repeat length.

**Methods**

A data subset of 5947 patients and controls across 9 features (3 motor, 3 cognitive and 3 psychiatric test scores) from the Enroll-HD data set were used. Analysis of the data included subtyping and stage inference (using the SuStaIn model), MCMC uncertainty estimation, 10 fold cross validation and t-tests between subtypes.

**Results**

Three subtypes with distinct progression patterns were found: Motor-led HD (Subtype 1), Cognitive-led HD (Subtype 2) and Psychiatric-led HD (Subtype 3). The proportions of subtypes in each group were 0.37, 0.33 and 0.3 respectively. Statistically significant differences were found between Subtype 1 and Subtype 2 and between Subtype 2 and Subtype 3, both with p-values of < 0.01. Statistically significant differences were not found between the CAG distributions of the subtypes (p-values > 0.3).

**Discussion**

This is the first time progression-based subtypes of HD have been found using clinical test data. The subtypes discovered could have large implications on HD treatment scheduling, drug discovery design and our general understanding of the disease (for example the Motor-led HD subtype contradicts a key existing clinical definition of HD which states that motor symptoms usually come later). Additionally, it was shown that the distinct progression patterns (subtypes) existed independently of CAG repeat length, fortifying the argument that CAG repeat length is not a suitable biomarker for predicting disease progression.
